I am currently enrolled in the Coding Dojo coding bootcamp.   I have worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Jinja, and with Flask.  
I also have a PhD in Geography, and teach both introductory Meteorology and Geospatial principles at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.  My previous research examines atmospheric hazards relative to population dynamics, and I have five first-author peer-reviewed publications total.
